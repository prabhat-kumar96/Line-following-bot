# Line-following-bot

This project is an Arduino-based line-following robot that utilizes IR sensors for path detection and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance. The robot is designed to autonomously navigate a path by following a black line and dynamically rerouting upon detecting obstacles, aiming to determine the shortest possible path using implemented algorithms.

## Features

- **Line Following:** Uses IR sensors to detect and follow a black line path.
- **Obstacle Detection:** Employs ultrasonic sensors to identify obstacles in the robot's path.
- **Path Optimization:** Implements algorithms to calculate and follow the shortest possible route.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- L298N Motor Driver
- DC Motors with Wheels
- IR Sensors
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Servo Motor
- Power Supply
- Chassis
